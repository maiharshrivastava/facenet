# Facial-Recognition-Based-Attendance-System-For-Teachers-and-Students-Using-Machine-Learning
Welcome to the GitHub repository for the project: a Facial Recognition-Based Attendance System designed for teachers and students. This project was developed in collaboration with a local non-profit organization aiming to bring sustainable, low computational cost solutions for automatic attendance systems to resource-limited schools in Pakistan.
## Project Overview
Our system leverages facial recognition technology to streamline the attendance process, making it more efficient and less time-consuming. By employing machine learning algorithms Haar cascade classifiers for face detection and k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) for face recognition, we've created a cost-effective and lightweight architecture. This ensures optimal performance across various devices, including both phones and PCs, making it accessible to schools with limited resources.
### Key Features

- **Low Computational Cost:** Designed with resource constraints in mind, ensuring it runs smoothly on minimal hardware.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Works seamlessly on both phones and PCs, providing flexibility in usage.
- **Sustainable Solution:** A collaboration with local non-profits to support educational institutions in Pakistan.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Implemented using HTML, Bootstrap, and JavaScript for a smooth user experience.
- **Efficient Backend:** Powered by Flask, ensuring a robust and scalable application.
